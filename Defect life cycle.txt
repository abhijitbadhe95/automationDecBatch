DEFECT LIFE CYCLE: it is a cycle through which a bug travel
new --> assigned --> open [Duplicate + deffered + rejected + not a bug] --> fixed --> pending retest --> retest --> reopen --> verified --> closed

new  : It is the first state of the lifecycle in which the bug is identified. Whenever a new bug is found, it is assigned a new state, and then the process
of testing and validation starts, which leads to new states

assigned  : The bug which was newly created is now assigned to the relevant developing department so that it can be fixed. Usually, the manager of the testing team
assigns bugs to the developing team. 

open  : When a developer starts working on the issue, it falls in an open state. Developers will start working on the bug according to the requirements. There are 
also chances that the issue won’t seem appropriate, in that case, the developer can transfer the issue to these four states based on specific reasons. 

fixed  : A state is marked as fixed when the developer performs necessary actions and the issues no longer exist.

pending retest : Once a developer works on the issue and fixes the required changes, it is sent back to the tester to test the issue again. The time which is consumed for 
the waiting of repeated testing, defect remains in the state of ‘Pending Retest’.

retest : When the tester starts testing the issue again, at that point the issue falls in the retest phase. The tester will check again if the developer fixed the bugs 
as per requirement or not.

reopen : If the requirements are not met properly and the issue still exists in the function then the tester reopens the bug state.

verified : If there is no issue in the bug and it was fixed properly by the developer then the state of the bug is changed and it is marked as verified. 

closed : When a defect does not exist and is tested and verified properly then it ends at a closed state. Tester changes the state of the defect.
